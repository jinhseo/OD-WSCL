# Configuration files

All the configs for supervised methods are removed. You can find them at markrcnn-benchmark [configs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/tree/master/configs).

Since we made changes to lots of places in this code, the performance of supervised models may also be affected.
To test the performance of them, we recommend using [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) or original [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark).
